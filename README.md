You will do this homework by editing the _README.md_ file. It's in
[MarkDown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and will be rendered to beautiful HTML when you visit your GitHub repo.

## Student Information
Please also edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:

_Student name_: Greg Sercombe

_Student NetID_: grs6

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Problem 1
- Scenario: Stadium
- Assumptions:
  I assume that I have a large budget giving me access to lots of resources. I also assume that the school uses the football team as a part
    of their marketing plan, so ensuring that the stadium is secure is very important.   Because this team is highly ranked, there will be lots of people
    moving around the stadium
  on game day and any incident will be televised nationwide. 
- Assets:
  There are many assets that are necessary to protect.  These assets include players from both teams, staff for both teams, fans of both teams, any
  stores in the stadium, secure areas of the stadium, and any sort of memorabilia in the stadium.  Without the players and staff, there can be no game. 
  The fans will be in the stands to enjoy the game but may get rowdy in the stands and could be a harm to themselves and others.  If alcohol is sold at
  the stadium, that would add to the potential danger to the fans.  The stores in the stadium hold merchandise, cash, and workers that will need
  protection.  The secure areas in the stadium need protecting because you don't want fans to get into areas that they have no business being.  These
  areas could include the two locker rooms and any maintenance areas.  The memorabilia needs to be protected because it is limited edition and
  carries a lot of values to the team and the fans.
- Threats:
  The threats mainly come from fans, especially those who are looking for some sort of exclusive experience or want to make some sort of scene.
  Another possible threat is someone who wants to steal the memoribilia or maybe even a playbook from an opposing team.  Furthermore, a fight
  could break out in the stands or out on the field.
- Countermeasures:
  The countermeasures that could be having metal detectors at every entrance and security on the field and ready to respond to the stands if a
  fight were to break out.  I also would have the secure areas locked.  Furthermore, I would have security with the teams and coaches
  while they are entering, on, and exiting the field.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: {Grading}
- Assumptions:
  I assume that I need to make sure that the files are secured and the grades are not mixed up between the students.
- Assets:
  The assets are the students papers and grades, as well as the answer key.  It is important to secure the papers and grades in order to protect
  the students privacy, so as to not violate FERPA.  The answer key needs to be protected because it could be used again the next semester for
  the same assignment.
- Threats:
  The threats come from the students and an accidental mishap from the teaching staff to release the students grades in an unconfidential format.
  Future students could try to find the answer key in order to have the answers for the next year.
- Countermeasures:
  The countermeasures that could be put into place are keeping the files in a locked drawer or locking the door to your office anytime you
  leave.  If the assignment is online, you would need a secure submission process and a way to secure your computer.  Another option is severe
  consequences to discourage any attempt to cheat (i.e. the Rice Honor Code).

## Problem 3
- Scenario: Holding valuables in a college dorm room.
- Assumptions:
  I'm assuming that I want a balance between securing the valuables and ease of access to my room.  Also, even though I live in a suite that can be
  locked, there are times random people will have access to the suite.
- Assets:
  The things that I want to protect would include my laptop, other valuables, and myself.  The laptop is especially important because all of my work
  for school is on it as a computer science major.
- Threats:
  The threats include anyone who access to my suite and at times access to Duncan College.  I typically leave my door open because the doors to my
  suite are closed and locked.  At those times, the only people who have access to the suite then are my other suite members and H+D.  There are other
  occasions when the suite doors are left open to allow people to enter so we don't have to keep answering the door.  At those times, I try to
  leave my door closed and locked.
- Countermeasures:
  I like to maintain a balance between ease of access to my room and security for my valuables.  Also, I'm not very good at remembering my keys
  all the time.  The most secure option would be to lock both my suite door and my room door.  However, this is unrealistic in the balance of ease
  of access and security.  As I stated above, I try to have one of the doors locked at all times but that doesn't always work.  The balance
  has come from communication with my suite on when the outside doors are locked or not, so I know when to lock my room door.
